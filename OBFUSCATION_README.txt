This package is an obfuscated/minified version intended to make source harder to read.
- HTML, CSS and JS are minified (whitespace/comments removed).
- Some function names were shortened (e.g. speakTR -> st1) to reduce readability.
Important: This is NOT secure. Determined users can still view and recover source.
If you need true code secrecy, consider server-side rendering or password-protected hosting.
